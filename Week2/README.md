# C++ Variable Types Exploration
This C++ program explores various variable types, creating all possible combinations of int, float, and double with long, short, and unsigned keywords. The program prints sizes, pointers, and min/max values of the variables, along with an explanation of auto variables, const, and constexpr keywords.

## Prerequisites
C++ compiler (supporting C++11 or later)
Standard Template Library (STL)

## Program Overview
The program generates all possible combinations of int, float, and double with long, short, and unsigned keywords. It then prints the sizes of the variables, sizes of their pointers, and the min/max values using std::numeric_limits(). Additionally, the program explains auto variables, const, and constexpr keywords.

## Variable Types
The following variable types are explored in the program:

- int
- short
- long
- unsigned int
- unsigned short
- unsigned long
- float
- double
- Fixed-Width Types

The code also investigates fixed-width types such as int(N)_t and float(N)_t (e.g., int32_t). These types ensure a specific size, providing control over variable sizes.
